In RMB city, Cao Fei discusses and critiques on the multi-identities of herself at the era of China’s urban and cultural explosion. It is an online art community, a platform and a concept piece where users can interact with and explore the webspace. It is an attempt to output the artist’s ideology and to engage the world with her designed space. Cao Fei reflects her cultural gaze at herself through RMB city. This is the true reflection of her experience in that specific time span and space. The article mentions that when we enter the virtual space, we may take up a self different from the image of our physical body. The avatars are “accumulations of imagination and desires”, and represents the dream of cyberspace as a space with stereotype of human and discrimination (Jim, 85). This statement bluntly points out that when on the Internet, we may become someone else because we can hide our physical bodies behind the screens and show our desires. Nevertheless, the act of stripping off our bodies and entering the virtual world with the avatar doesn’t help eliminating the existing stereotypes. We still long for becoming the majority and the mighty. We discriminates others so as to “express our true selves”.
