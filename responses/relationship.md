It seems that Evans is promoting that in terms of romantic relationship, we need to think carefully about how it is brought to the webspace. She argues that since every click leaves traces online, our expression of love online is documented and thus could be advertised and exploited. I don’t quite agree with this point. It is true that sending out moments in weChat about my romantic relationship looks like and may well be an advertisement, and that even if I delete it, it may still be somewhere in the database. However, the act of sharing persists from the beginning of the human society. Moreover, my posts is most meaningful to myself and its importance degrades as it spreads out my social circle. It may not mean anything to a complete stranger, especially when the post is among the flood of posts of other people’s “none sense”. Therefore, sending posts in the public sphere online should be treated natural, in today’s social media context.

I personally love to send weChat messages than speaking on phone, just as Evans preference for email. I feel safe when the records of chat is kept in my phone in case I need to search for anything in the future. WeChat is an extension of my memory, and it in turn challenges people’s relationship in terms of memory. When conversation is made face-to-face, one may not need to worry about their counterpart bringing up the exact conversation content many years later to prove something. What’s being said fleets with the unreliability of humans’ memory. Therefore, the recorded weChat messaging relationship is a relatively new relationship to experience, but we have been very easily adapted to it. It is ok to feel natural about it just as what I have stated in the previous paragraph. Accept it just as what we are already doing.
