## Description
This project aims to inquire into the mindset of a website as a conscious being: What would it do? What is its capability and distinctiveness?

The journey unfolds with the choice of male/female voice (using responsive voice API to convert from text to speech). Then the user's name is asked and later on searched in Youtube to generate a song (using Youtube API and axios client). Lastly, the website ask the user to take a photo, and show the base64 for the photo itself.
